## Usage

The webpage is intended to be used as a study guide, with notes on certain coding-related topics included. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git were the main areas of focus that were highlighted in the creation of this study guide. Of particular note is the addition of JavaScript functions running while looking at the DevTools console, to help give a visual demonstration of that particular topic. One of the functions helps randomly decide a topic to study first as well!
